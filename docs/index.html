    <h1>File Sharer</h1>
    <h2>Share your files locally between all internet capable devices</h2>
    <p>One of the big problems of the smartphone devide between Android and IOS is the file transfer.</p>
    <p>You either cave and store your files in the cloud leaving them to unauthorized access or just don't share them at all.</p>
    <p>What happened to locally sharing files between devices?</p>
    <p>The File Sharer solves this problem: You can provide a small web interface where anyone in your network can upload any file and download all the files you provide.</p>
    <p>You can either let people use your hotspot or your router.</p>
    <p>Only share files over networks you controll as this app does not use any security.</p>
    <h3>Be the connection between devices in your social circle.</h3>
